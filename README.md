We are The Stormers and our App tries to bring science to all audiences by focusing on an increasingly frequent phenomenon. Solar storms.

Without and further away this same night there will be one of strong magnitude in which the northern lights can be seen at medium altitudes and even some communication systems will be affected.

Our App shows as a presentation what the solar storm of May 2024 meant. In which payment systems, GPS, radio frequencies, etc. were affected in various countries around the world.
Some countries around the world such as Canada took preventive measures to avoid blackouts caused in previous similar situations.

At the same time, we wanted to also show an interactive simulator so that the user can contrast the various effects at different intensities. In parallel, there is also a history of the most notable events recorded, as well as a glossary to promote scientific dissemination, making science available to everyone.

We do not want to finish without first showing a small mini-game for the enjoyment of everyone who visits our App, and thus establish a first step of approach and interest for the most reluctant.

As you can see, this is a first idea of ​​what in the not too distant future will become a necessary consultation tool, in the same way that we consult the rain forecast today.

Knowledge and contact with geomagnetic data will be a necessity for the correct functioning of many elements of our daily lives.
